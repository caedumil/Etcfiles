# Advanced Power Management (-B) (if the drive supports it)
# A low value means aggressive power management and a high value means better
# performance.  Possible settings range from values 1 through  127 (which
# permit spin-down), and values 128 through 254 (which do not permit spin-down).
# The highest degree of power management is attained with a setting of 1, and
# the highest  I/O  performance  with a setting of 254.  A value of 255 tells
# hdparm to disable Advanced Power Management altogether on the drive (not all
# drives support disabling it, but most do).


# Low-Power mode / Standby (spindown) timeout (-S)
# The encoding of the timeout value is somewhat peculiar.  A value of zero
# means "timeouts are disabled": the device will not automatically enter
# standby mode.  Values from 1 to 240 specify multiples  of  5  seconds,
# yielding timeouts from 5 seconds to 20 minutes.  Values from 241 to 251
# specify from 1 to 11 units of 30 minutes, yielding timeouts from 30 minutes
# to 5.5 hours.  A value of  252 signifies a timeout of 21 minutes. A value of
# 253 sets a vendor-defined timeout period between 8 and 12 hours, and the
# value 254 is reserved.  255 is interpreted as  21  minutes  plus  15 seconds.
# Note that some older drives may have very different interpretations of these
# values.
